# Work Hour Calculator

### This application is written in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio 2017. I made this application before I learned programming at school. 

#### Motivation:
I was doing a part-time work and had trouble caluclating the hours I worked every day. I was too lazy to calculate by hand, so I made an application.

#### What it does:
This application calculates all the hours worked in the period of the time.

#### Compatibility:
This application only works properly in a resoultion bigger than 1366x768.

#### How it works:
1. Set what month you are in and its start date and end date.
2. Set last month's start date and end date to be included in the calculation.
3. Press "Apply Dates" button.
4. Type in all the hours and minutes worked for each day in the table.
5. Press "Calculate Daily Total" button.
6. Press "Calculate Monthly Total" button.
